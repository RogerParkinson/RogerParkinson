### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Roger

<img src="me.jpg" alt="">
I'm a software engineer who likes working with Java and C++, and sometimes with Kotlin and Go. There are two kinds of repositories here. One is (mostly Java) software I've developed in the course of my professional life, the other contains details of my electronics projects which includes C++, Eagle PDB layouts and 3D print files.

My repositories include:

 - Madura framework: a rules based framework that uses rules to minimise writing code.
 - Home automation: my home automation software using ESP8266 boards and a BeagleBone
 - Vortex Manipulator: a smart watch with extras
 
You'll find lots more details on my website [www.madurasoftware.com](https://www.madurasoftware.com)

I'm currently working on a startup project which uses GKE, KeyCloak and KillBill.
